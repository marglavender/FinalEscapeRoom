  <p>Ahoy maties!We have recently discovered a mysterious island off the coast of Mykonos, Greece that is filled with puzzles and riddles in order to uncover treasure. We have heard from around the island that there is a hidden treasure lurking beneath and we need your help to find it. It appears to have been a wealthy pirate who spent a lot of time and effort to cover up his traces of what he was doing and where the treasure is located. We now assume that his last remaining treasure is hidden on this newly discovered island. You will be expected to uncover clues, decipher codes, complete puzzles, and solve riddles in order to gather more clues to lead you to the treasure.

The time is of the essence my friends as there is another crew searching for the treasure. You must get to the treasure first to receive all of the secretive treasures this pirate has hidden. If you don’t find the treasure before the other crew you won’t receive your well deserving treasures. Be sure to look out for hidden clues and always be aware of your surroundings as you start your journey. We are calling upon you for immediate help. Good luck!
